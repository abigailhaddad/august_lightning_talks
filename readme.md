# August 22 Lightning Talks: Data Science DC

* This is a repo for information about the August Lightning Talk event with Data Science DC. 

## Some resources about giving lightning talks:

[Some handy guidelines on giving a lightning talk](https://github.com/tracykteal/lightning-talks)
>Lightning talks are great opportunities to highlight what you're working on and can be on many different topics, including technical talks, community building, project updates, documentation and many more! Lightning talk sessions that have a variety of topics are the most interesting! 
>Practicing can be helpful, so you get your timing down, and also so you feel more comfortable once you're on the stage. Even if you sign up that morning, since it's short, you can run through a practice during a break. Grab a friend or even a peer you just met at the meeting, and ask if you could practice for 3 minutes.

>First of all, let’s look at the point of a lightning talk. The point is to make a point, and explain it as quickly as possible. That’s it. Understand?
>One of the best tactics is to make your point as early in the talk as humanly possible. You might need to set up the problem space, explain why you were doing what you were doing before you can explain your point. Fine, but do it quickly. You really shouldn’t spend more than a minute explaining the background before you make your first point. If you haven’t explained the main point by minute three you’re probably up the proverbial creek without the paddle.

## Talk Names/Speakers/Descriptions

Dr. John Kaufhold, Data Community DC advisor and startup founder, will explain the significance of one obscure, yet crucial, equation in the Attention is All You Need paper, particularly focusing on one-hot encodings. John will be giving the full version of his talk at our September 20 event, How Attention in 2017 Got Us ChatGPT. You can RSVP for it here.

Will Angel, Lead Consultant at Excella and CEO of Data Community DC, will discuss data visualization community-building by visualizing ten years of Meetup events.

Dr. Rebecca Bilbro, Founder/CTO at Rotational Labs, challenges the traditional machine learning workflow and offers a quick tour of an open dataset repository for real-time data science projects.

Alex Gurvich, NASA Data Visualization Specialist, uses elements of data storytelling in support of the newly opened Earth Information Center to better communicate how NASA's mission extends beyond space to study the Earth.

Llewellyn Jones, Accenture Data Scientist and journalist with Investigative Economics, details the benefits of applying statistics in journalism and possibilities in finding stories with data.

George Rooney, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Fable, will discuss LoRA, a method that makes adapting large neural networks like GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion more feasible by significantly reducing trainable parameters and GPU memory requirements.

Chandana Sapparapu, Lead ML Engineer at Sunayu, will talk about getting an LLM to answer questions about your unstructured data using text embeddings plus vector databases.

Professor Jennifer Sleeman will talk about neuro-symbolic learning, its role in scientific discovery, and how LLMs can take this work to a new level of understanding scientific language.
