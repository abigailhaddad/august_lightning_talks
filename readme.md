# August 22 Lightning Talks: Data Science DC

* This is a repo for information about the August Lightning Talk event with Data Science DC. 

## Some resources about giving lightning talks:

[Some handy guidelines on giving a lightning talk](https://github.com/tracykteal/lightning-talks)
>Lightning talks are great opportunities to highlight what you're working on and can be on many different topics, including technical talks, community building, project updates, documentation and many more! Lightning talk sessions that have a variety of topics are the most interesting! 
>Practicing can be helpful, so you get your timing down, and also so you feel more comfortable once you're on the stage. Even if you sign up that morning, since it's short, you can run through a practice during a break. Grab a friend or even a peer you just met at the meeting, and ask if you could practice for 3 minutes.

>First of all, let’s look at the point of a lightning talk. The point is to make a point, and explain it as quickly as possible. That’s it. Understand?
>One of the best tactics is to make your point as early in the talk as humanly possible. You might need to set up the problem space, explain why you were doing what you were doing before you can explain your point. Fine, but do it quickly. You really shouldn’t spend more than a minute explaining the background before you make your first point. If you haven’t explained the main point by minute three you’re probably up the proverbial creek without the paddle.
